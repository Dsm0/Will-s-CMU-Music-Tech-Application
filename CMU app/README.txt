A few notes:

1-
Even after the deadline, I will continue to upload projects that I'm working
on/work I've done because, well, I really enjoy it. This will include code, audio recordings,
and I even have a piece I'm working on for my blog in the school newspaper about the nature of sound.

2-
These are not typical files you'd run in python. I've laid the code out to be
run in foxdot/a live coding enviornment, where you can skip around and
evaluate/change the lines you want.

3-
Of course, and especcially if your name is Riccardo or Colby,
this begs the question of "should I run the scripts myself?"
There are so many dependencies and installation procedures required 
that you'd be spending too much time on one applicant.
(even with all the extra text and video you have to slog through).

If you do try, I've listed everything below and will be flattered. But I'd advise against it.
