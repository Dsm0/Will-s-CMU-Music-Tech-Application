# Will-s-CMU-Music-Tech-Application
scripts, tinkerings, audio + visual, stuff Willhas done or plans to do soon is here in one place

Video descriptions of code will be linked in each project folder

Will's music + tech portfolio::::::::::::
	(every piece, I would assume, is studied and conducted. I guess I performed one of them)

-Audio waveform visualizer inside command prompt
	-python

-Basic MIDI to Keyboard script
	-supercollider

-Function Iteration translated to audio: Spider Web Diagrams
	-python

-Function Iteration translated to audio: Orbit Diagrams
	-python

-Live Coding Performance Using the other two programs I've listed
	-haskell (tidalcycles)
	-python

A few notes:

0-
The text files I submit likely won't be identical to the ones in the video, because a lot of
live coding is changing things on the fly. The only differences will be FoxDot synth parameters.

1-
Even after the deadline, I will continue to upload projects that I'm working
on/work I've done onto Github because, well, I really enjoy it. This includes code, audio recordings,
and I even have a piece I'm working on for my blog in the school newspaper about the nature of sound.

2-
These are not typical files you'd run in python or haskell. I've laid the code out to be
run in foxdot for python/a live coding enviornment, where you can skip around and
evaluate/change the lines you want. Same goes for tidalcycles.

3-
Of course, and especcially if your name is Riccardo or Colby,
this begs the question of "should I run the scripts myself?"
There are so many dependencies and installation procedures required
that you'd be spending too much time on one applicant.
(even with all the extra text and video you have to slog through).

If you do try, I've listed everything below and will be flattered.

But it's a lot.



DEPENDENCIES:::::

Both Require:
